### What is this?
This site is a running archive of the builds I have done on [c.nerd.nu](https://nerd.nu) rev 38 in 2025.  

They are broken down in to 3 main categories- Industries I have created (usually with retail locations and a supply chain), Mesa City- a city build 100% by me, and various structures I have built in Spawn City, the main shared city on the server.
