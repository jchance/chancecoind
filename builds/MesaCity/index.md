# Mesa City
> Another Fine ChanceCo Industries Community

## Overview

Built in the badlands biome where most players don't care to build, Mesa City was created so I wouldn't fill up Spawn City and leave some plots for the other players :P

Red Sandstone themed, Mesa City is the official "ChanceCo Company Town" with all aspects of life controlled by the benevolent dictatorship of the ChanceCo Industries board of directors.
