# Mesa City Water Authority Dam
> It's even got working floodgates!

---

The Mesa City Water Authority Dam is located on the outskirts of Mesa City and impounds the millions of cubic meters of water that comprises the Mesa City Municipal Reservoir, the only potable water source in the badlands.

The Fake News Media reports of nearby ChanceX rocket laucnhes contaminating the water supply with perchlorate have been greatly overblown. *Any further inquiries should be made to the ChanceCo Legal Department.*
