# ChanceCo Industries!
> Adderall is a hell of a drug.

My evenings are basically a mix of boredom and ADHD medication, so I tend to hyperfocus on building things.  This leads me to building a shop, then building a supply chain to support that shop, then building supply chains to support that thing in an endless cycle.  As a result, I've started multiple industries on the server with end user shops / facilities, distrubution centers, production facilities, transportation vehicles, and more.

> If you're looking at something and it makes zero sense, its probably an inside joke with other players on the server or a dad joke.  Things like "I built a nuclear power plant, then another player built competiting windmills and a battery factory, so I built a lithium mine so he has to buy his raw materials from me."  That kind of thing.
