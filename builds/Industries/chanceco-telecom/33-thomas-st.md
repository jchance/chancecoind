# ChanceCo Telco Longlines Building
> A bit imposing isn't it?

---

This building is based on 33 Thomas Street, the AT&T Longlines Building in NYC. The actual building, if made to scale, would be nearly 2x as large but the design was scaled down to fit a Spawn City plot.

According to a 2016 report by [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2016/11/16/the-nsas-spy-hub-in-new-york-hidden-in-plain-sight/){:target="_blank"}, 33 Thomas St. functions as “NSA’s spy hub in New York, hidden in plain sight.”
