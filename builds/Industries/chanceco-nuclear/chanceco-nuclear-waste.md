> Secure, long term deep geologic storage for radioactive waste

---

### Solving the problem of radiological waste

CNWR is a deep geologic repository for radiological waste and featues multiple levels of storage vaults, outdoor dry cask storage, high level radiation cooling pools, ventilation, and a connection to nearby [Red Mesa Prison](/builds/Industries/red-mesa-prison/) for a source of cheap (free) hazardous environment prison labor.

It is located in close proximity to [ChanceCo Nuclear Power](/builds/Industries/chanceco-nuclear/chanceco-nuclear-power) and has a direct access road to the facility.  There is also an underground connection to [ChanceCo Nuclear Enrichment](/builds/Industries/chanceco-nuclear/chanceco-nuclear-enrichment).

### Deal with Bardweiser Brewing

Bardweiser Brewing has leased a deep geologic vault for the doomsday storage of Bardweiser Beer and the vault can be found at the back of the bottom storage level.
